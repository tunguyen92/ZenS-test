                A child asked his father, "How were people born?" <br />
                So his father said, "Adam and Eve made babies, then their babies became adults and made babies, and so
                on." <br />
                The child then went to his mother, asked her the same question and she told him,<br />
                "We were monkeys then we evolved to become like we are now."<br />
                The child ran back to his father and said, "You lied to me!"<br />
                His father replied, "No, your mom was talking about her side of the family."
